# Docker Environment for Human Motion Synthesis Platform 

This is a server-client environment, where the Robot Simulation setup intereact with [SPOT](https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/) based setup for LTL formulation. 

### How to deploy
**robotic-sw-env** foleder comprises the contents of the Robot Simulation environment.
  - Dockerfile (containes all the necessary commands to assemble an image for automated build)
  - requirements.txt (list of libraries needed for simulation)

**spot-env** holds the files for SPOT based environment.

For building and starting up both the environments, run **docker-compose.yml** from the project directory with the following command
```bash
$ docker-compose up

Recreating docker_compose_test_spot-env_1      ... done

```
Compose pulls the desired images, builds the images for the code, and starts the services defined in both Dockerfiles. Both of the services run two jupyter notebooks in two separate ports **8000 and 8001**. You need token to run both of these notebooks. Open a browser and go to **https://localhost/port_number**, a jupyter login page will pop up that requires token for authentication. From the notebook url presented above (after running the compose up command) for each of the environments, copy the token part and paste it in the coprresponding jupyter login page to enter the jupyter notebook environment. 

### Mounted volume in local directory
Both of the services is mounted on a local directory called **spot-env-shared-volume**. First you should create this folder at your `home` directory in Linux. Otherwise the folder created after **compose up** command will make it a private forlder, which will not let you create files in docker environment.

### LTL Graph parser
The jupyter notebook build from the **spot-env** Dockerfile comes with a SPOT installed enviroment. It creates notebook ready for development with SPOT Library for LTL, Ï‰-automata manipulation and model checking in Python 3. The commands for the source code build for SPOT can be found on the corresponding Dockerfile. The dockerfile will also install a small python module called [ltl-grraph-parser](https://pypi.org/project/ltl-parser-pkg/). Currently the version 0.1.2 will come with the default installation. If you want to change it or extend it, you can modify it into the **ltl_graph_parser.py** file in the [ltl_parser](https://github.com/rezaurrakib/ltl_parser) repository.
